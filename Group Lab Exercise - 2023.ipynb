    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A promising family of algorithms for near-term quantum computers are called variational optimisation algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are hybrid algorithms with a classical optimiser and a quantum sub-routine. The quantum sub-routines in these algorithms generally have the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a specified state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "2. Estimate the expectation value of an observable $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the simplicity of this family of quantum circuits which makes it convenient for small scale near-term quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise you will compare **two different methods** of estimating an expectation value on the IBMQ chip, and determine which of them performs best.\n"

    "### Warm up exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "To get some practise with expectation values, and using QISKIT to estimate them, we warm up with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will estimate the expectation value for a range of states for the observable $Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z$ has the matrix form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a general single qubit state $|{\\psi}\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$. It has a column vector representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation value of $Z$ with respect to $|{\\psi}\\rangle$ is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle {\\psi}| Z|{\\psi}\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha* & \\beta* \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix}=|\\alpha|^2 - |\\beta|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is an easy calculation, the matrices involved scale in size to $2^n$ by $2^n$ for an $n$-qubit state. Therefore this calculation, in general, is not expected to be efficiently acheivable on a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator expectation values therefore represent a very simple form of potential quantum speed-up. "

We will need to consider below that the eigenvalues of $Z$ are $+1$ and $-1$ while the outcomes of the measurement in QISKIT are 0 and 1.\n",
